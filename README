This will hold the taskforce addin files, hopefully segregating it from the MonoDevelop svn trunk effectively.

To try it out, checkout the MonoDevelop source tree
cd extras/
mkdir MonoDevelop.TaskForce
cd MonoDevelop.TaskForce
git clone (check it out from github in this path)

You should add this existing project/solution to the MonoDevelop workspace, and have built it already.

This is being built as a Google summer of code project for MonoDevelop by Anirudh Sanjeev <andy@ninjagod.com> under the mentorship of Michael Hutchinson <mjhutchinson@gmail.com>.
