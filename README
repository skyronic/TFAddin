This will hold the taskforce addin files, hopefully segregating it from the MonoDevelop svn trunk effectively.

To try it out, checkout the MonoDevelop source tree
cd extras/
git clone git://github.com/ninjagod/TFAddin.git
mv TFAddin MonoDevelop.TaskForce

Add absolute path to MonoDevelop.TaskForce/build to the main.addins in local-config. Also, you might have to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the absolute path to local-config

You should add this existing project/solution to the MonoDevelop workspace, and have built it already.

This is being built as a Google summer of code project for MonoDevelop by Anirudh Sanjeev <andy@ninjagod.com> under the mentorship of Michael Hutchinson <mjhutchinson@gmail.com>.
